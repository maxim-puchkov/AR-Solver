 ViewController
 
 1. The view will display UIButtons, such as:
    * __NEW__:              Take a new image with a camera
    * __SELECT__:           Choose an existing image from the library
    * __MANUAL__:           Input a string in a UITextField
 
 2. When the input is determined, user will have access
    to new UIButtons:
    * __SIMPLIFY__:         Simplify the expression
    * __CANONICAL FORM__:   The expression will be simplified and
                            canonicalized to its unique form
    * __DERIVE__:           Differentiate in terms of a variable. The
                            result is then simplified and canonicalized
 
 3. After the final result is calculated, its textual representation is
    displayed in a UILabel at the bottom of the MainMenuViewController;
    __or__ an error message is displayed instead
